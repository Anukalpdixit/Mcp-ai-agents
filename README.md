# Mcp-ai-agents

Mcp-ai-agents is a Python project focused on implementing MCP-based AI agents using the Agno framework.

## Description

This repository provides a collection of AI agents designed around the MCP (Multi-Agent Control Protocol) architecture, utilizing Agno as the core engine. The goal is to enable flexible, scalable, and modular agent behaviors suitable for research, simulation, or practical deployment scenarios.

## Features

- Modular AI agent architecture based on MCP principles
- Leverages the Agno framework for interoperability and extensibility
- Written in Python for ease of customization and integration
- Designed for experimentation with agent behaviors and protocols

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- [Agno framework](https://github.com/your-agno-link) (please update with the actual link)
- Recommended: virtualenv or similar environment tool

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anukalpdixit/Mcp-ai-agents.git

```

### Usage

Update this section with usage examples as the project evolves. Typical usage might involve running a main script, configuring agent behaviors, or integrating with other systems.

```bash
python main.py
```
